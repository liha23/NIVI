# Memory System Test Examples

## Testing the AI Memory System

Here are some example conversations to test the enhanced memory functionality:

### Test 1: Basic Memory Test
1. **First Message**: "Hi, I'm working on a React project and need help with state management."
2. **AI Response**: Should provide React state management advice
3. **Follow-up**: "Can you show me how to use Redux with that?"
4. **Expected**: AI should reference the previous React project context

### Test 2: Cross-Session Memory
1. **Session 1**: Discuss Python programming and data analysis
2. **Start New Chat**: "I want to continue with the data analysis we discussed"
3. **Expected**: AI should reference previous Python/data analysis conversation

### Test 3: Topic Continuity
1. **Message 1**: "I'm learning JavaScript and struggling with closures"
2. **Message 2**: "Can you explain async/await?"
3. **Message 3**: "How do closures relate to async programming?"
4. **Expected**: AI should connect closures and async concepts

### Test 4: Long Conversation Memory
1. Have a conversation with 30+ messages about a specific topic
2. Ask a follow-up question about something mentioned early in the conversation
3. **Expected**: AI should reference early conversation context

### Test 5: Memory Management
1. Go to Settings > Data & Privacy
2. Check AI Memory Management section
3. View memory statistics
4. Test "Clear AI Memory" functionality

## What to Look For

### Positive Indicators
- AI references previous messages: "As we discussed earlier..."
- AI builds on previous topics: "Building on what you mentioned about..."
- AI asks contextual follow-ups: "Would you like to continue with the previous topic?"
- Memory indicator shows in chat header
- Settings show memory statistics

### Memory System Features
- **Contextual Responses**: AI remembers what you've talked about
- **Topic Continuity**: Builds upon previous discussions
- **Smart Follow-ups**: Asks relevant questions based on history
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Remembers across different chat sessions
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Creates summaries for long conversations

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Programming Help
```
User: "I'm building a todo app in React"
AI: [Provides React todo app guidance]
User: "How do I add local storage to save todos?"
AI: [Should reference the React todo app context]
User: "What about adding user authentication?"
AI: [Should build on the todo app + local storage context]
```

### Scenario 2: Learning Journey
```
User: "I want to learn machine learning"
AI: [Provides ML learning path]
User: "What programming language should I start with?"
AI: [Should reference ML learning context]
User: "Can you recommend some projects?"
AI: [Should build on ML learning + programming language discussion]
```

### Scenario 3: Problem Solving
```
User: "My website is loading slowly"
AI: [Provides performance optimization advice]
User: "I'm using WordPress"
AI: [Should reference the slow website context]
User: "What about database optimization?"
AI: [Should connect WordPress + performance + database context]
```

## Memory Indicators

### In Chat Interface
- Memory indicator in header (shows number of summaries)
- AI responses reference previous context
- Follow-up questions show memory awareness

### In Settings
- Memory statistics display
- Clear memory option available
- Memory usage information

## Troubleshooting

### If Memory Isn't Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Ensure conversations are substantial enough
4. Check memory statistics in settings

### Performance Issues
1. Clear old memory data
2. Check memory usage in settings
3. Restart browser if needed

The memory system should make conversations feel more natural and intelligent, with the AI building upon previous discussions and providing more contextual, helpful responses.
